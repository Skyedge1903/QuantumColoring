# Discovering quantum computing


## Self-training

## Writing a WIKI containing:
- The basics of quantum computing
- Explanations about the different quantum gates and their use
- Presentation of the algorithms that can benefit from quantum computing
- A comparison with classical computing (specifying that they are complementary) 
- A presentation of the IBM programming interface

## Implementation of a small quantum algorithm and presentation of the results
